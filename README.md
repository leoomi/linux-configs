# linux-configs
My personal configurations for a linux environment (and even some windows) for software such as neovim, hyprland, terminal emulators, etc.
setup.sh is a very badly written script to backup and create symlinks to the files inside this repo.
The idea is to have a centralized and versionable repo for my configuration files, so I hopefully won't have to redo work to setup my dev environment in the future.

If you found this repo for whatever reason, feel free to use it as a reference, but be warned that I don't know what I'm doing super well.
