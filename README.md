# linux-configs
My personal configurations for a linux environment for software such as neovim, i3, kitty and picom.
setup.sh is a very dumb script to backup and create symlinks to the files inside this repo.
The idea is to have a centralized and versionable repo for my configuration files, so I hopefully won't have to redo work to setup my dev environment in the future.

If you found this repo for whatever reason, feel free to use it as a reference, but be warned that I just hardcoded a lot of stuff and don't really know what I am doing. I just copied a lot of stuff ThePrimeagen did for his nvim config and I'm new to this setup.
